An open-source social network focused on the people that would be using it.

You can find the product, once it's live, here: [dead link until product is live](https://github.com/pjbollinger/one-update#OneUpdate)

## Background

I am not fond of social networks as they exist today.
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. appear to be focused on keeping users on their platform for as long as possible.
Specifically, it feels that they are prioritizing the user consumption of as many feed items as possible, wanting users to scroll with no end.

I would like to propose a new social network:
* A social network that is focused on getting immediate updates from your friends and family but only the latest one, hence the name _OneUpdate_.
* A social network that is focused on transparency by remaining open-source.

Part of this is an experiment to expand and test my knowledge of software engineering.
Also, part of this is an experiment to see if I can make an open-source project that is a living product for others to learn off of.

## Contributing

I labeled this as a `hacktoberfest` project since I will be open to contributors as the product is fleshed out.
However, until the base project is set up, I won't be accepting PRs but open to issue creations to discuss anything.
